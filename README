To make: 

	$ make

To run:

	Place page link input file in the same directory as the made class files. 
	If it's in the wrong directory, it will tell you where to put it.
	
	$ java PageRank <inputFile.txt> <numberOfPages>
	
Output:
	
	The PageRank program will print out sets of page ranks, each separated by a space, for the pages using the
	following algorithms:
	
	-Power Iteration, interpreting the input file as "SRC linksTo DST"
	-Monte Carlo, interpreting the input file as "SRC linksTo DST"
	-Power Iteration, interpreting the input file as "DST linksFrom SRC"
	-Monte Carlo, interpreting the input file as "DST linksFrom SRC"

	Note that the Monte Carlo results are not directly comparable to the 
	Power Iteration results. The MC results are a distribution of probabilities
	for each page, where as Power Iteration is a loose "spread" of a certain "total
	amount of page rank"
